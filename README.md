# HUM 5837 Course Documents - Text Encoding Unit

This repository contains example documents for the Digital Humanities II course (HUM5837). Your final products for the text encoding portion of the course all correspond to example files in this repository. On the first day of class, you should [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your own account, so that you can edit the files for your own project.<sup>1</sup> If you would like me to make comments and give feedback directly in your files, you should give me collaborator status on this repository (you do this by navigating *your version* of the HUM5837 repository, going under "settings" and going to "collaborators"). Otherwise, I will comment on your files through opening issues/submitting tickets about your repository.

This repository contains the following files:

* [doc-analysis.md](doc-analysis.md)
* [documentation.md](documentation.md)
* [reflection.md](reflection.md)
* [your_schema.odd](your_schema.odd)
* [your_schema.rng](your_schema.rng)
* [your_style.css](your_schema.css)
* [your_style.xslt](your_schema.xslt)
* [your_tei.xml](your_tei.xml)

At the end of the six week course session, you should have preliminary versions of each of these files prepared. Specific course information is available in Canvas. If you have any questions about the assignments, you can create an issue in your own repository and tag me (@scstanley7) in the text of the issue.

<sup>1</sup> You can ignore the part about pull requests, and focus on the section about using someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea
